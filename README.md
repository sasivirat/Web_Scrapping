# Web Scraping and Machine Learning API Project

## Overview
This project involves scraping data from the web, processing it, and using it to train and deploy a machine learning model. The project also includes an API for users to interact with the trained model.

## Technology Stack
- **Python Libraries**:
  - Web Scraping: `BeautifulSoup`, `requests`
  - Data Preprocessing: `pandas`, `numpy`
    
## Setup
### Prerequisites
1. Install Python (version >= 3.8).
2. Install required dependencies.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the integration of web scraping, machine learning, and API development. Future improvements could include automating the data update process, improving model accuracy, and deploying the API to a scalable cloud platform.
